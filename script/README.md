# Automating Apple Provisioning

This notebook is a step-by-step guide to automate the Apple provisioning process using Python.
The provisioning process is a necessary step to deploy iOS applications on real devices.
The process involves creating a certificate, an App ID, and a provisioning profile.

The provisioning process is a bit cumbersome and involves multiple steps.
This notebook will guide you through the process and automate it using Python.

## Install required Python packages

Before running the script, make sure to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Generate your private key and CSR

If you havenâ€™t already, create the private key/CSR pair locally (this key is different from the .p8 Apple gives you; this is specifically for the iOS distribution certificate).
Enter a password when prompted.
You'll need this password later.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out keys/ios-dev.key 2048
openssl req -new -key keys/ios-dev.key -out keys/ios-dev.csr \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=TX/L=Dallas/O=JinagaLLC/CN=JinagaLLC"
```

You'll upload this CSR to Apple via the script below.

## Create a distribution certificate

Run the Python script to upload the CSR to Apple and create a distribution certificate.
